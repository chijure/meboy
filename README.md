MeBoy Change Log
-

version 1.3: 24 May 2007
-

* Added support for Gameboy Color games
* Added support for multiple saved (suspended) games at once
* Added support for partial loading of very large ROM files (for phones with
  limited RAM)
* Added support for realtime clock (used by Pokemon Gold etc)
* In addition to frameskip, number of frames per second is displayed
* Fixed minor keyboard handling bugs, Japanese Pokemon games should work better
  now
* Fixed overflow bug that could occur after 2^32 instructions
* Fixed minor windowing bug, Dragonball Z 2 should work better now
* ROM files are split into smaller files, which reduces RAM requirement
* MeBoyBuilder: Now supports zipped ROM files (one ROM per zip file)
* MeBoyBuilder: Now tries to verify that the selected files are valid Gameboy
  carts
* MeBoyBuilder: Can now (optionally) automatically check for updates

version 1.2: 4 Mar 2007
-
* Added support for rotating the screen (with a slight performance penalty)
* Added speed throttling in the unlikely event that MeBoy exceeds 60 fps
* Added support for rarely used "LCD control operation" for turning off the LCD
* Fixed flag handling bug for increment/decrement instructions, other minor
  flag handling bugs
* Fixed timing of screen update interrupts, to better match JavaBoy and
  hopefully Gameboy. Grabbing items while spinning in Metroid 2 no longer
  causes freeze
* Fixed minor keyboard handling bug
* Fixed palette bug (some sprites had incorrect colors, such as Bugs Bunny and
  some enemies in Super Mario Land 2)
* Fixed version bug (1.1 identifies itself as 1.0)
* MeBoyBuilder: Now has a simple UI with some instructions and information
* MeBoyBuilder: Non-ascii characters in filenames now handled
* MeBoyBuilder: Warning when selecting large ROM files and Gameboy Color games
* MeBoyBuilder: MeBoy.jad file is produced, since certain phones seem to
  require it
